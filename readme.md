#Spatial Data Production
##Presentation for everything_conf

- The goal of my presentation will be to show how simple it is to generate spatial information using text processing.
- I'll show the structure of a simple KML document, and use Ruby to batch-convert a set of text into a KML features.
- I'll demonstrate a technique for getting spatial coordinates in the first place using a geocoding API.
- Finally, I'll tie the two together, converting a list of addresses into features on a map with a few lines of code.
- A tertiary goal is to demonstrate the simplicity of text-procesing, and to encourage people to understand the data structures they are working with before turning to a gem. Sometimes data is simpler than you think.
